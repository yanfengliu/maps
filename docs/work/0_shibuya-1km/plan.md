## Problem and outcome

Build the approved roughly 1 km square of Shibuya as a believable browser world with moving pedestrians and vehicles. Supreme Satellite visual quality is the current priority. Progress means visible improvement independently reviewed and integrated on main; helper passes/docs are not product progress. The goal is ACTIVE. Full-map quality, population and performance acceptance remain OPEN.

## Scope

AOI: 35.6550–35.6640 N, 139.6950–139.7060 E; crossing origin: 35.6595 N, 139.7005 E. [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md), [local rules](../../policies/local-rules.md), [design](design.md) and the [network contract](../../reference/network-contract.md) retain world/source/gate contracts.

Non-goals: map viewer, navigation/routing, survey-grade reconstruction, second location, new product surface or shipping target. Simulation research and Cartographic polish are deferred; population/performance/two-style requirements remain. Styles share geometry/camera/simulation; basic real-input switching is required.

## Approach

Root owns priorities, contracts, this sole status record, acceptance and integration. Workers own bounded diagnosis, implementation and checks. Read it at turn start and before delegation; keep at most three next outcomes, park dependencies, reassess after two failures for one reason and land verified increments on main.

### Current adoption and evidence

Adopted `9e4508ee3f7ca4e75ed853ae73e71a82112ce7be`: original Coca-Cola artwork above TSUTAYA receives authored dusk emission. [1449](reviews/1449_coca-cola-source-emission.md), independent [1450 PASS](reviews/1450_coca-cola-integrated-review.md). One source-bound quad/radiance0.65; narrow non-letter border unlit, glazing/roof excluded. Noon visually normal with existing0.05 floor. Zero added geometry/textures/lights; one shader branch, isolated cost unmeasured. Earlier ground/windows/frontage work preserved; no final criterion closes.

PRIMARY five gates PASS: build/types,133 files/1,173 tests in71.479s, audit(two existing moderate advisories), visual `82fa77ecdca2b44c`:44frames/three lifecycles in288.179s, RTX4090/616.64. Native review:matched noon/dusk block pair,22canonical Satellite/two current Satellite-to-Cartographic control frames. Four runtime files match worker build; maps excluded. Default5970698 actual actor started locally; no motion/actor-continuity/FPS claim. Pre-start permission refusals retained; scoped completions passed.

Main/origin-main read back exact. Fresh remote APIs:zero checks/statuses/workflows; CI unavailable, no pass claimed. Checkout/registration retired normally after preservation. 1449closeout18:54UTC:51owned identities absent, task markers/4319/TEMP clear. Evidence/cache retained; historical trees and unrelated ancient tail untouched.

Runtime cache: 156 files/364,187,965 B, SHA-256 `288997c50656c4adc6300b42beaa52903247b6c55e8cf22beb314954f4f32e62`; older 157-file certificates do not transfer. Preserve user-owned `test/facade-emission.test.ts`, AGENTS.md and991 snapshot.

### Current operation and next outcomes

[1455](reviews/1455_hachiko-stone-transition-stop.md) STOP confirmed by [1456](reviews/1456_stone-edge-stop-review.md); retired normally with frozen evidence.19:38UTC:12 owned identities/TEMP clear.1445/1452 failures stay stopped; no tuning/full gates. [1454](reviews/1454_tsutaya-source-quality.md): local TSUTAYA chart128x512; other imagery UNKNOWN.

[1457](reviews/1457_next-visible-milestone.md) accepts the [future benchmark](1457_visual-benchmark.md)/[disqualifiers](1457_visual-disqualifiers.md), no old rescore. Next: photo-backed recesses across batch26's20-window field. Windows1458 source/views sealed; phase2 DISPATCHED.

Profile COMPLETE/worker CPU UNAVAILABLE; follow-up PARKED. `artifacts/orchestration-context-20261017/profile/profile-summary.json`. Historical65 worktrees: inventory COMPLETE/removal PARKED; preserve first, product priority. `artifacts/retained1421-inventory/summary.json`.

| Next outcome | Owner/status | Dependency and done condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recessed photo-window field | windows1458 phase2 DISPATCHED | 20 bays/0.32m,<=240tri/32KiB; source/board/lifetime fixed. Baseline sealed, one prototype/no tuning; `artifacts/windows1458/phase1-freeze.json`. |

No global blocker. This is the sole dispatch queue. Final acceptance needs matching evidence and independent integrated review on main; local milestones close no criterion.

## Acceptance criteria

The 14 original criteria remain OPEN for final acceptance. Historical checks/local milestones establish only their named bounds.

- A1. Terrain, buildings and roads render end to end across the full AOI, inspected from several angles/zooms at native resolution.
- A2. The Shibuya valley and Dōgenzaka slope read in the terrain; building footprints neither float nor sink.
- A3. Close buildings have floor-count window rhythm and light-responsive PBR materials, checked at street level and above.
- A4. The dusk crossing reads as Shibuya through emissive signage and neon.
- A5. Road markings match reference imagery, including scramble diagonals, with signals, guardrails and street furniture in place.
- A6. Dusk uses ACES, neon bloom, SSAO and TAA without flicker/crawl over a moving sequence.
- A7. Over a run, vehicles hold lanes, obey signals, turn, and spawn/despawn at the boundary.
- A8. Pedestrians avoid each other and surge diagonally on the signal phase, without visible interpenetration or sliding feet.
- A9. One clock/phase model drives both populations; no traffic moves through an occupied scramble.
- A10. 60 fps at 1920×1080 with 3,000 animated pedestrians and 200 vehicles; name measured hardware, build and timing window.
- A11. Rebuild derived geospatial outputs from a clean checkout, render again and compare the result.
- A12. The running app shows PLATEAU (PDL 1.0, CC BY 4.0 permitted), OSM (ODbL) and GSI attribution plus required processing credits.
- A13. Native multi-angle/zoom sweep and real-controls flythrough over time are clean; independent review passes and the result is merged to main.
- A14. Both Cartographic and Satellite hold up at street/block/aerial distances; pointer/keyboard dropdown changes both ways preserve camera/agent progress and use an extensible registry. Detailed Cartographic review is deferred during the Satellite focus.

## Implementation steps

These are the 35 stable identities across phases 0–10; never renumber. Item 35 was appended to Phase 4. F = integrated foundation, requiring final recheck; O = partial/open, including narrowly accepted capabilities. Neither means final deliverable acceptance.

### Cross-map bounds and parked dependencies

Whole-AOI quality remains open: close/block/aerial views, peripheral blocks, noon/dusk, fixed and held-out seeded exploration. Record seeds, poses, inspected-byte digests and temporal sampling gaps. Inspect Satellite originals natively and check basic style continuity. Final traversal/building clearance remains open; [445](reviews/445_camera-only-native.md)'s 857 m ascent is a route-coverage bound, not a clearance height.

Facades still need convincing depth/glazing, floor rhythm, de-light and variation across representative buildings. Every road remains in scope. The historical 32-object remainder is seven carriageways (five expressways), three intersections and 22 semantically unknown LOD1 objects, not 32 proven paint omissions. No published paint overlaps the 27 non-expressway objects; expressways need separate layer work. Source/layer/LOD binding, lane semantics and nine-stratum/held-out native coverage remain open. Distributed mounted dusk lighting needs source selection, supported occupancy, density/sightlines and a same-run refusal histogram. Wet/ground/tree/base contact and crossed-paint authenticity remain open. Unadopted 413/420 and rejected facade/tree/ground/lighting branches are parked; exact source exceptions remain in the historical progress record.

Default rail acceptance is narrow: exterior gaps/bearings/returns, actors under spans, temporal coverage and a recognizable supported train passage remain open. Vehicles need joined wheel/body contact, bus/portal/class coverage, spacing and visible governed signal behavior; the old fixture has no governed entry. One ordinary walker is accepted, not a full crowd. Supported full-source eligibility, animated soles, avoidance, no sliding/interpenetration and broader default flow remain open. The 150-pedestrian/20-vehicle seed 5970698, 600 s contract remains red/unqualified before untuned seed 42/native event evidence. Motion/contact experiments stay parked.

Continuous populated/camera/time stability remains unqualified by sparse stills. Historical ~12 fps and 59/200 vehicles are bounded failures, not current measurements or a reduced target. [398](reviews/398_gpu-delight-startup-comparison.md)'s startup gain is not population FPS; machine-cold startup, port-5319/loading/decoder causes and custom HTTP certification remain unknown/unestablished. Simulation research deferral does not delete A7–A10.

Private union 1324 remains UNMET. Its 387/63-part proof chain constrains that experiment, not every valid product construction. Preserve its evidence/obligations; do not resume it by default or transfer helper passes to main. No new launch/admission/report framework or weaker gate is authorized.

## Outcome

Active; full deliverable incomplete. The adoption/evidence and next-outcome sections above hold current status. Full-map, temporal and population/FPS acceptance remain open.

Exact old `plan.md` and `progress.md` remain in [Git at e483cd5](https://github.com/yanfengliu/maps/tree/e483cd5dfa58ee89876fba268c55c619daca9d5f/docs/work/0_shibuya-1km). Recover with `git show <commit>:<path>`; exact sizes/digests are in [1418](reviews/1418_orchestration-context-implementation.md). Authored reviews are unchanged; history is not a current queue.
